::: {.notes}

TODO: friendly and supportive, people show stuff they've never shown before, it's a safe space.

UTC varies to make it equivalent to 5pm UK time

rainbowR hosts a monthly meet-up for community members to 

- Connect with each other
- Stay updated on rainbowR developments
- And to join in an informal 'show and tell', for example to showcase a project or R package they've been working on

The meet-ups are held on the third Wednesday of each month at 4pm UTC.

You can convert this time to your local timezone using the `lubridate` package in R. The next meet-up, on July 24th at 4pm UTC, will take place at 6pm here in Salzburg.
